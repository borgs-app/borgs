# Borgs

## Introduction

Borgs is an all in one smart contract that generates, breeds and facilitates the sale of borgs. The protocol serves as an open standard to be used or build upon for generative art on the blockchain. Anyone is free to take this project and use their own art to generate similar projects. This project contains:

- A hosted service which listens for Borg events and copies them to a database for quick access 
- A sync for backdated events
- An API which provides public access to view borgs
- The Borgs contract itself
- An uploader that populates the contract ready for generations (although you must provide your own images!)
